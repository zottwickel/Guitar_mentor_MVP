# Guitar_mentor_MVP
This is the minimum viable product or alpha version of my Guitar Mentor app.<br><br>

I wanted to make this app nice and sweet and to the point. Using the Guitar Party API, I wanted people to be able to search a song, choose that song from a list, and then be able to see the lyrics and chords so they can learn the song and add it to their list. I hope to use this app myself as I learn guitar in my spare time!<br><br>

This app is live at https://zottwickel.github.io/Guitar_mentor_MVP/
